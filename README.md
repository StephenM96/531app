### Problem Core

My aim was to develop an app that emulates the utility of personal spreadsheets for athletes and casual gym-goers across the globe. This tool will utilize a streamlined and simple formula to curate workouts, offering projections for long-term progress. In the future, it will also incorporate provisions for scheduled breaks and deloads, ensuring systematic strength progression according to the userâ€™s tailored goals.

# General Notes - Disregard...

-Break out functions into separate components

-Set up nav bar to navigate between pages

-Connect login auth from backend to frontend
-Validate email or username on login - put some pseudocode in LoginPage.jsx to play with lines 25-45 08/11/23 6:19 AM

-Add calendar dropdown? Plan workouts through the calendar
