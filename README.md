# 531app
Turning 531 into an app

Need to do:
-Break out functions into separate components

-Set up nav bar to navigate between pages

-Connect login auth from backend to frontend
    -Validate email or username on login - put some pseudocode in LoginPage.jsx to play with lines 25-45 08/11/23 6:19 AM

-Add calendar dropdown? Plan workouts through the calendar
